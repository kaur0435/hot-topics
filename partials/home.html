    <p>It has been said that money is the root of all evil, and that seems to be true more and more
        so each year. Some money is necessary to live, and to live comfortably making $100,000
        a year, there is no one that needs more money than that to live. Too many people place
        too much value on money. People go to work for 8 hours a day, come home, and have to
        feed their families and pay bills, and they always complain about the lack of money. This
        is true to some extent, but it is not necessarly what they make that is hurting them, it is
        what they are spending. People in general make decent money but they blow it all on
        fancy cars, or eating out, or not investing properly. If they valued saving money, or didn't
        value what extra comes with money, people would be in a better place both mentally and
        Every advertisement and every media presentation has people in America thinking
        they are not good enough.<br>
        The media plays a role much too large in our everyday life. They show the
        extreme sides of life, and very little in between. Everyone seems to get what they want,
        and that takes money. Take for example all the ciggeratte advertisements. Something as
        simple as a ciggeratte advertisement says a lot about ourselves. We value looking good,
        feeling good, all the time. That is not what life is about, life is about working hard and
        achieving, even if it is for personal gain. Once we achieve something, then we should
        save it, not waste it, but the media and advertisements encourage us to do just the
        Money isn't always the most important thing in life.<br>
        We live in a materialistic world. Just ask Madonna! Most everything in our lives is centered on money, and the love of it. Sometimes, it makes me wonder what kind of lives my children will live. Will they know the value of a dollar? Or, better yet, will they know that there are some things you should never trade for money? Money is a powerful thing in our society, but, when it comes down to it, money will pass away like everything else.There are numerous things I wouldn't ever give up for any amount of money. Take family, friendships, and true love, for examples. How could you give up your morals, your character, or the things you believe in for something as transient as money? You cannot put a price on the intangible things in your life that you hold close to your soul. I would never trade the values my mother and father have instilled in my life.<br>
        There is no amount of money or any kind of bribe that would make me give up things that my relatives have given me. Whether the teddy bear my grandfather gave me when we were going through a hard time, or that old end table in our house that my great grandmother used to put her bible on, there is no way that special things from my family could ever be traded. Even though the old jewelry of my grandmothers collects dust in the drawer, it is special to me because she wants me to have it.
        The tangible things we own are easier to price, but some things, I could never part with. Possessions are just possessions, mainly, but when something has personal significance, it is a different story. There are specific rules in my house when it comes to selling things at a yard sale, on Ebay, etc. You cannot sell anything that has a name, has ever had a name, or anything we would cringe at the though of selling. For example, my older sister played a flute in the band her sixth, seventh, and eighth grade years of school.

<h2>GMO food</h2>

        The term GM foods or GMOs (genetically-modified organisms) is most commonly used to refer to crop plants created for human or animal consumption using the latest molecular biology techniques. These plants have been modified in the laboratory to enhance desired traits such as increased resistance to herbicides or improved nutritional content. The enhancement of desired traits has traditionally been undertaken through breeding.GMO’s are unnatural. Is it healthy to eat something that doesn’t belong in our digestive system? GMO’s are genetically modified food. Genetically modified foods are created by taking genes from plants and animals and inserting into our food to alter the genetic engineering. In 1984, GMO’s were first introduced when a plant was modified from antibiotic resistant tobacco.
        <br>
        In 1994, genetically modifying food was approved by the FDA.The popular method for genetic engineering of crop plants is natural gene transfer via an Agrobacterium tumefaciens vector, a bacterium normally found in soils. The transfer-DNA (T-DNA) vector is made by inserting the desired gene fragment in between specific 25bp repeat domains in the bacterium. The vector is then inserted into the Agrobacterium and "the virulence gene products of Agrobacterium actively recognize, excise, transport, and integrate the T-DNA region into the host plant genomes." (Conner et. al, 1999) The amount of DNA transferred is only about 10kb and the nature of the gene is usually well understood.<br>
        The expression of the gene introduced can also be controlled by adding additional sequences that might allow the gene to be constitutively expressed, expressed only in certain cell types, or expressed as a result of different environmental changes. This method of gene transfer, however, will only work for the natural host range of the bacterium and therefore other methods are used for additional crop plants. Such methods are uptake of naked DNA by electroporation or particle gun bombardment. The use of genetic markers, as mentioned previously, allows for the preferential growth of cultures that contain the new genetic.I was a kid, science teacher taught me Genetically Modified Food is the research of the future and will lead to solving the famine issues of the future. I heard lots of scientists were researching the Genetically Modified Food and that they had already ended the experiment. So I thought no one would have to bear hunger. Nowadays, despite the progress on Genetically Modified Food, many people continue to suffer from famine.<br>
        As genetically modified food appeared into people’s consciousness, it had been at the center of vehement controversy. Because people lack information about genetically modified food’s potential influence, they wonder whether genetically modified food is a miracle or not. Genetically modified food can solve several problems. The potential effects of genetically modified food also should be measured.
        Ever wondered what has been put into everyday food and what the impact is on human health? Approximately 60-80 % of everyday food has one ingredient made from genetically modified foods. When hearing “genetically modified food” people automatically think it is only bad for health, but there is also a good impact surprisingly. The one bad thing is that people do not know what types food have been modified because there are no labels for GMO products.

        The Internet will be in your contact lens. Imagine blinking, and then instantly going on line, accessing your home office, or home entertainment system anywhere or anytime. We will be able to download any movie, song, Web site, or piece of information off the Internet directly onto our Internet-enabled contact lenses. These lenses will also be able to identify people’s faces, translate their comments and provide subtitles, so that we will always know exactly with whom we are speaking and what they are saying in any language. We will live in a cross between “The Matrix” and real life. Tourists will love this, for example, since they will be able to see the glory of the Roman Empire resurrected in their contact lens as they walk among the ruins of Rome. Artists and architects will love it, as well, since they will be able to create great works of art by simply moving their hands in the air. People suffering from illnesses, like diabetes, will love it, too, because they will have immediate readouts of their heart rate, insulin levels, and other important conditions within their own bodies.<br>
        Computers will disappear, as will cellphones, clocks, watches, and MP3 players. Chips, costing less than a penny apiece, will be hidden by the millions in the environment. We will be able to command these hidden computers telepathically, directly via the mind. Computers will interpret the electrical signals emitted by our brains, decipher them, and carry out our wishes. When we walk into a room, we will be able to mentally control a computer that in turn will direct the many things around us. Moving heavy furniture, rearranging desks, and brewing a cup of coffee may be possible just by thinking about it. So we will be like the gods of mythology, mentally manipulating the world around us. We will also be able to conjure up almost any object just by wishing for it. This is done via “programmable matter,” which consists of millions of microscopic computer chips, which are intelligent and can be programmed to suddenly rearrange themselves into any shape or object on command, so that we will be able to create almost anything we can imagine (this is very similar to the Replicator from “Star Trek”).<br>
        Our cars will be driver-less, using GPS to navigate without the help of an alert human behind the wheel. These cars will also fly (finally!) by floating on a cushion of magnetism. With room-temperature superconducting magnets, our cars and trains will glide effortlessly in the air without bumps or potholes to worry about since the crafts hover over the treacherous road. Traffic jams and accidents will be a thing of the past as a central computer will be able to track the motions of all the cars on the road (or air), while each car will use radar in its fenders to sense obstacles and take emergency measures as soon as it senses an impending accident. Best of all, we will hardly ever need to fuel up, since there is almost no friction to slow us down. This will also solve the energy crisis, since most energy is wasted, strangely enough, on overcoming the friction of the road.
        Doctors will be able to grow “spare parts” for our organs as soon as they wear out. This will create a “human body shop.” We will never need organ donors and never die of organ failure. Even the typical doctor’s visit will change.<br>
        For a routine checkup we will talk to a robotic software program that will have a complete record of our genes. This robotic MD will be able to correctly diagnose up to 95 percent of human ailments. If the robot can’t help, then the patient moves on to a living and breathing doctor who can help figure out the rarer disease that takes a more refined and sophisticated mind. By mid-century, doctors and scientists may be able to construct an entire organism using its genome alone. As this genome science progresses, researchers may be able to carry a small kit around with them and, in mere minutes, sequence the entire genome of any life-form they encounter. We will then be able to resurrect extinct life-forms, such as the mammoth, dodo bird, and even the Neanderthal (There are ethical concerns with the Neanderthal. Do we put them in a zoo or put them through college, one scientist pointed out to me). In the movie “Jurassic Park,” scientists extracted DNA from dinosaurs and inserted it into the eggs of reptiles. Although usable DNA from dinosaurs has yet to be found, there is evidence that in the future this dream might become a reality. That means by the end of this century, our zoos may be populated by creatures that ceased walking the surface of the earth millions of years ago.
